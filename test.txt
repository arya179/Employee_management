I VOWED UNTIL DEATH DO US PART.

HERE I STAND AND WATCH MY ART RIP ITSELF APART.

AND WHO COULD BLAME YOU?

HOW COULD I EVER CONVINCE YOU MY FINGERS WOULD FEEL BETTER BETWEEN YOURS THAN THAT HALF PUN CIGAR?

HOW COULD I EVER SHOW YOU THE SUN WHEN YOUR DRUNKEN EYES LOOK FOR STARS.

HOW COULD I EVER COMPARE TO YOUR PILLS AND NEEDLES I WAS FOREWARNED?

How could a reptile ever love
The SEA girl?

IT CHOKES MY THROAT WRENCHES MY GUTS.

WHEN I SEEM ALWAYS FALL SICK INTO YOUR DRUGS.

THE STORY OF A MAN WHO CHOSE THE KNIFE AND THE GIRL WHO WATCHED HIM CUT.

UNTIL DEATH DO US PART. 

HONESTLY MEANT FOREVER WHEN I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE HEART.
